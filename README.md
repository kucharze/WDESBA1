#The main page

This page is the main information page. It includes some basic information, along with some pictures to show card types. Some pictures are represented by gifs. The pictures also get bigger when you click on them, and the text enlarges and the background changes color.

This page includes two basic forms for Signing up and Logining in. A drop down menu is included in the signup form.

This page includes a table with the top 5 most expensive cards. Animations are included to make the pictures bigger when you hover over them.
